# Smishing Detection Using Machine Learning

A machine learning-based system for detecting **Smishing (SMS Phishing)** messages that trick users into sharing sensitive information such as passwords or banking credentials.  
This project uses natural language processing (NLP) and multiple ML classifiers to automatically differentiate between **legitimate (ham)** and **fraudulent (smishing)** SMS messages.

üß† Project Overview

With the rise of mobile communication, **smishing attacks** have become a serious cybersecurity threat.  
This project develops a **privacy-preserving, on-device smishing detection model** that identifies deceptive text messages‚Äîeven those using obfuscated words like ‚Äúcl!ck‚Äù or ‚Äúv3rify.‚Äù

Key features include:
- Automated text preprocessing and feature extraction using **TF-IDF**.
- Handling class imbalance using **Random OverSampling**.
- Evaluation of multiple ML models.
- Adversarial testing for real-world message manipulation.

‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture

The project follows a modular pipeline:

1. **Data Collection** ‚Äì SMS dataset from Kaggle with ham and smishing messages.  
2. **Text Preprocessing** ‚Äì Lowercasing, stopword removal, URL and punctuation cleaning.  
3. **Feature Extraction** ‚Äì TF-IDF vectorization (max 5000 features).  
4. **Label Encoding** ‚Äì Encoding ‚Äúham‚Äù and ‚Äúsmishing‚Äù labels numerically.  
5. **Balancing Dataset** ‚Äì Using `RandomOverSampler` to address class imbalance.  
6. **Model Training** ‚Äì Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost.  
7. **Adversarial Testing** ‚Äì Evaluating robustness to obfuscated keywords.  
8. **Evaluation** ‚Äì Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix analysis.
